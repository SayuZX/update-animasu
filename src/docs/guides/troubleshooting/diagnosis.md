# Diagnosis

Facing issues with a source or the app?
Follow these steps to troubleshoot and find solutions.

## Primary diagnosis

1. **Manual Series Refresh**: Drag down to manually refresh problematic series.
1. **Test Other Series**: Try different series from the same source.
1. **Update WebView**: Ensure your WebView is current.
1. **Public WebView**: Attempt opening series in public WebView. Wait for CAPTCHA or Cloudflare protection if needed.
1. **Change Connection**: Switch networks (Wi-Fi, mobile data, VPN) and confirm IP change.
1. **Collaborative Check**: Get others to replicate the error.
1. **Source Status**: Verify the source's status in a browser.
1. **Retry Button**: Look for a retry button on the series page.
1. **Advanced Settings**: try these options:
   - Clear Cache
   - DNS over HTTPS
1. **Download Issues**: Delete the queue and retry downloads.
1. **Restart Kuma Anime App**: Force close and reopen the app.

## Personalized issue
If you're the only one facing a problem, you might be encountering [Cloudflare](/docs/guides/troubleshooting/#cloudflare) protection, an IP ban, or other countermeasures set by website owners against programs like **Kuma Anime**.

**To minimize future issues:**
- Avoid using downloads with the source.
- Reduce the number of series in your library from that source.
