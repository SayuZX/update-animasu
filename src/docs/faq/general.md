Frequently Asked Questions

## Why isn't Kuma Anime on the Google Play Store?
**Kuma Anime** won't be on the **Google Play Store**.

APK-based extensions conflict with [Google Play's content policy](https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy/).
**Google** might take down the app due to certain content, which the developers wishes to avoid.

## Is Kuma Anime available for iOS/iPadOS?
There is no iOS or iPadOS version and neither are there plans for one.
Porting is difficult due to the separate codebases of iOS and Android apps.

Any app proclaiming to be "**Kuma Anime for iOS**" is not by us and should be treated as a scam.

## What is Kuma Anime Preview?
**Kuma Anime Preview** is a regularly updated beta version of the app.
It showcases potential upcoming features, but it's more prone to bugs and crashes.

::: warning CAUTION
While it's ideal for users seeking the latest **Kuma Anime** experience, it's essential to keep [auto-backup](/docs/guides/backups#enabling-automatic-backups) enabled to prevent library loss due to issues.
