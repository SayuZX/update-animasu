# Getting started

Essential information to help you get set up with Kuma Anime.

## Installation guide

### Downloading Kuma Anime

2. After the download is complete, open the `.apk` file.
3. Proceed with the installation process.

### Series search options

If you want to search for series across all your sources, you can use the Changes Provider Server.

Follow these steps:

1. Go to the "**Settings**" section.
2. Ensure you're on the "**General**" tab located at the top-right corner.
3. Use "**Default Provider**" to find source from all available.

### Trouble finding a specific series?

If you encounter difficulties while searching for a specific series, consider the following points:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD004 -->
* Double-check your spelling and try again, as some sources might use **Japanese romanized** titles instead of **English** ones.
  > Example: **Boku no Hero Academia** instead of **My Hero Academia**.

* Some sources may use different spellings or wordings for titles.
  > Example: **Bungo Stray Dogs** instead of **Bungou Stray Dogs**

  > Example: **3-gatsu no Lion** instead of **Sangatsu no Lion**.
